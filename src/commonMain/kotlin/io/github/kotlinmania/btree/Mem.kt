 * `intrinsics::abort` so a panic mid-transition can never expose a moved-out
 * slot. In Kotlin there is no `&mut` to a stack value and no moved-out state
 * to hide — the caller assigns the returned value back. If `change` throws,
 * the caller's binding keeps its previous value, which is the safe outcome
 * the panic-guard was simulating.
